# DOMmy.js

## DOMmy.js is a powerful yet super light Javascript library which allows Javascript developers to write less code while dramatically improving efficiency. The goal of DOMmy.js is to "enhance" the syntax of Vanilla Javascript, making it more elegant and less verbose, using Vanilla Javascript, with no need for anything else but Vanilla Javascript. DOMmy.js is a standalone, no-dependency script, meaning you can use it alone or along you favourite framework.

### The core of DOMmy.js lies in two functions: `$` and `$$` which allows to respectively select one element by id and a full collection of elements by a CSS selector. Once you get your element or element collection, you can use the DOMmy.js methods to seamlessy work with DOM operations. Setter methods, like `html`, `css`, `on`, `attr` etc. allow to set data, and are chainable, while getter methods such as `getStyle`, `getCSS`, `getAttr` etc. allow to retrieve data.
